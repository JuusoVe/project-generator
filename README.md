# Wrapping your head around all the repos

-   This repo is referred to as **generator_repo**
-   The template from which we generate customer repos are referred to as **template_repo**
-   The customer repos created programatically are referred to as **target_repo**

No repository should be referred to without specifying the type as one of these.
Each repo type will also have test copies associated with it. in this case the type is
prepended with **test\_** ie:

**TEMPLATE_REPO_NAME** env variable specifys that this is the name of the repo to which
we push the template code. If we were to store a test-specific value for this env to be used in we would specify that by naming the secret **TEST_TEMPLATE_REPO_NAME** and then load it into a environment key without the **TEST\_** prefix
